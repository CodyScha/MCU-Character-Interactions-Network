# MCU-Character-Interactions-Network

This is for a capstone project in CS490: Analysis of Social and Biological Networks. This project uses OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo model to parse MCU transcripts for character interactions. These character interactions will be used to create a network across all of the characters in the MCU.
